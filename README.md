## Dataset

The project uses a synthetic but realistic dataset containing 1,000 samples with:
- **Square Footage**: House size in square feet (800 - 6,000 sq ft)
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms (1-6)
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms (1-4)
- **Age**: House age in years (0-50 years)
- **Distance to City**: Distance from city center in miles (1-50 miles)
- **Price**: Corresponding house prices ($50,000 - $711,000)

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Generation & Preparation
- Generate synthetic but realistic house price dataset (1,000 samples)
- Create 5 relevant features with realistic relationships to price
- Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)
- Divide data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

### 2. Multiple Model Training
- **Linear Regression**: Basic multiple linear regression
- **Ridge Regression**: L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization for feature selection
- **Polynomial Regression**: Captures non-linear relationships (degree=2)
- **Ridge with Polynomial Features**: Combines polynomial features with regularization

### 3. Advanced Evaluation
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV for robust performance assessment
- **Multiple Metrics**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference between actual and predicted values
  - **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference
- **Model Comparison**: Automatic selection of best performing model

### 4. Comprehensive Visualization
- **Actual vs Predicted**: Scatter plot with perfect prediction line
- **Residuals Plot**: Analysis of prediction errors
- **Model Comparison**: Bar charts comparing RÂ² and MSE scores
- **Feature Importance**: Coefficient analysis for linear models
- **Residual Distribution**: Histogram of prediction errors
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Feature correlation analysis

## Model Interpretation

The best performing model (Linear Regression) provides:
- **Intercept**: Base price when all features are zero
- **Coefficients**: Price impact of each feature:
  - Square Footage: +$119.43 per sq ft
  - Bedrooms: +$15,009 per bedroom
  - Bathrooms: +$18,977 per bathroom
  - Age: -$1,950 per year (depreciation)
  - Distance to City: -$3,131 per mile
- **Equation**: `Price = 4,815 + 119.43Ã—SF + 15,009Ã—Bed + 18,977Ã—Bath - 1,950Ã—Age - 3,131Ã—Dist`
